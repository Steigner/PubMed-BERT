# PubMed-BERT

This is a hobby project where I tried Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) on the BBBP dataset. The dataset contains molecules represented using SMILES (textual representation of chemical structures) notation and NAME, where each molecule has a binary label: 

* 1 (Penetrant) → penetrates the BBB
* 0 (Non-penetrant) → does not penetrate the BBB.
